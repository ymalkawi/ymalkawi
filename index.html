PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
C4 
Amman
Product Development Manager
Aug 2009 – Current

Responsible for the design, management, and development of C4 (construction management web-application) including a set of responsibilities such as - but no limited to- team building , features pipeline, task scheduling, technical decisions, and database design and programming.

Oversaw the requirements collection process to reach a scalable collaborative platform that suits different client needs.

C4 implemented over 10 projects in the MENA region with 250 users. 

C4 Characteristics:
Reports & Analysis Module: Developed a flexible module that calculates metrics that are necessary to analyze the data.
Multi-Tenant-Data Architecture: C4 was designed to work with single code base and multiple databases.  Each client connects to a different database. This architecture provided a better performance and higher scalability.
User Roles & Permissions: User roles were designed to allow/deny different access permissions, accordingly.
Custom behavior: Code was injected to allow C4 to respond to the specific requirements of each client preserving the same code-base.

Key Features/Integrations:

1. Document Viewer:
Deployed LeafletJS to view documents instead of maps. This feature allowed the user to view large documents efficiently and view construction drawings as Google Maps .

2. Work-load Queuing:
Due to heavy load of the tasks that involved image processing and file conversion, we have deployed a load-balanced environment to farm-out the processes to other servers.

3. Full-Text Search:
For proper document management, Apache Solr was implemented to allow users to search and filter a vast amount of documents, instantly. 

4. Document Content Indexing:
Successfully extracted and indexed content of files such as Microsoft Documents, PDF files, Images, etc. Therefore, users were able to search within different attachment formats. 

5. Desktop Application:
An offline version of the application was developed; it provided a limited version of the application to handle the problem of clients who suffered from limited Internet access. Backbone.js and Nodejs were used.

Other Projects:
I have also managed the development of several projects like:
- Design and development of the website.
- Developed a simple CRM application to manage the relationship between sales, developers ,and management. This was done using Ruby on Rails.

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
